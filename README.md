# Rc-phase--shift-oscillator-using-transistor
A RC Phase Shift Oscillator is a type of oscillator circuit that generates a continuous sine wave output by using a combination of resistors and capacitors (RC network) to provide the necessary phase shift. When a transistor is used in this configuration, the circuit is typically a BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) or FET-based oscillator.
